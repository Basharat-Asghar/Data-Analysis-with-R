# Maven Airline Satisfaction Score Analysis
### Data Prep
* Converting column names to snake-case names.
* Removing NA values as they have very low percentage of total observations.
* Create different age categories for age variable, as well for departure and arrival delay and flight distance.

## Recommendations :
* Middle-Age customers should get more attention, as they are in bulk.
* Young & Old customers must also get good services.
* In-Flight-WiFi-Service, Ease-of-Online-Booking, Gate-Location, Food_and_Drink, Departure_arrival_time_convenience, these services should be improved on, as they have the average rating lower than overall average rating.
* In-Flight-Service gets highest average rating, but still need improvements, as most dis-satisfied percentage of customers is also from this service.
* First-Time customers should get high quality service, so, that they can be convinced to return more often.
* Personal travelers, Economy & Economy Plus class travelers should also receive high quality service.
* Overall all services provided by company need improvements.
